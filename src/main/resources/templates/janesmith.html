<p1>Hello, my name is jane.
    I was looking for a way to upgrade my skills.
    I like computers.
    I am interested in working in the field.
I though it would be nice to change jobs.
This was satifying to learn new skills and improve my abilities.  I feel i learned a lot.  I am glad
i came to this school. I learned new things.  I especially like computer skills.</p1>
